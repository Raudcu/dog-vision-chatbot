        "The goal of this project is to build a Telegram bot capable of telling a dog's breed from a photo of it. \n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, I'll be using data from the [Kaggle dog breed identification competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data). It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.\n",

        "For the model, I'm going to use a pretrained deep learning model from TensorFlow Hub (I'll be using TensorFlow to train a model leveraging Transfert Learning).\n",

        "For the first part (getting data ready and training the model) I'm going to elaborate further (a lot) on a hands-on project from the zerotomastery [Machine Learning Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/).\n",
